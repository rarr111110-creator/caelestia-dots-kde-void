// Tells KWin where each taskbar entry sits, so minimize/restore effects have
// something to animate towards.
//
// KWin's Magic Lamp effect animates a window into its "icon geometry" — the
// rect the taskbar occupies for that window. Nothing publishes that here: the
// dock is a Quickshell surface, not a Plasma panel, so KWin has no icon
// geometry for any window and the effect falls back to guessing from the
// cursor. That is why the animation follows the pointer around, and why
// putting a real Plasma panel underneath the dock "fixes" it.
//
// The taskbar side of the plasma-window-management protocol is what Plasma's
// own Task Manager uses for this (libtaskmanager sets it from the task
// delegate's rect).
