// How the shell starts other people's applications.
//
// Spawning them as plain children hands them the shell's stdio, and the shell
// may have been started detached (`quickshell -d`, `caelestia shell -d`), which
// points stdout and stderr at /dev/null. Vesktop deadlocks when a call starts
// in exactly that state - issue #402, reproducible on its own with
// `vesktop >/dev/null 2>&1`.
//
// So the launch is wrapped in systemd-cat, which execs the application with
// its output on the journal and changes nothing else about how it runs.
//
// Nothing else about it, deliberately. Launching applications as transient
// systemd *services* also fixes this, and additionally gives them the session
// environment and their own unit - but a service's lifetime is tied to its
// main process, and desktop launchers do not survive that. Heroic gets moved
// into KDE's own app-heroic-<pid>.scope as soon as its window appears, which
// empties the unit systemd was watching; systemd then tears the unit down and
// signals whatever is still in the cgroup, which is the game. umu-run dies in
// its signal handler and the game is left on a blank window.
//
// app2unit stays available for anyone who wants the app in its own unit, under
// services.useSystemd. It uses a scope by default, which does not have the
// lifetime problem a service does.
