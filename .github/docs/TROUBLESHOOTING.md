## 1. Build & Compilation Issues

### 1.1 C++ Installer Compilation Fails

The installer compiles the `caelestia-install` TUI binary during `setup.sh`. The CMake project requires **C++20** (`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20`).

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `g++: command not found` | Build tools not installed | Arch: `sudo pacman -S base-devel` — Fedora: `sudo dnf install gcc-c++` — Debian: `sudo apt-get install build-essential` — Void: `sudo xbps-install -S base-devel` |
| `cmake: command not found` | CMake missing | Auto-installer handles this if `BASE_DISTRO` is detected; otherwise install manually |
| `[FATAL] Failed to build the Caelestia installer` | General CMake/make error | Read build log: `cat /tmp/caelestia_build.log` |
| Compiler error about modern C++ features | GCC older than 10 | Ensure GCC 10+ is installed: `g++ --version` |
| Exit 139 (SIGSEGV) at runtime | C++ bug in the TUI | Check stderr log at `/tmp/caelestia_installer_err.log` |
| Exit 127 at runtime | Missing shared library | Run `ldd` on the binary to find missing `.so` files |

### 1.2 Shell / Plugin Compilation Fails

The shell build (`08-build-shell.sh`) requires **Qt 6.9+** and several system libraries. The CMake project in `shell/CMakeLists.txt` uses `qt_standard_project_setup(REQUIRES 6.9)`.

#### Qt / QML Dependencies

| Missing Dependency | CMake Error Clue | Arch Package | Fedora Package |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qt6::Qml / Qt6::Quick | `find_package` failed | `qt6-declarative` | `qt6-qtdeclarative-devel` |
| Qt6::ShaderTools | Shader tool config | `qt6-shadertools` | `qt6-qtshadertools-devel` |
| Qt6::WaylandClient | Wayland client plugin | `qt6-wayland` | `qt6-qtwayland-devel` |
| KF6WindowSystem | KWindowSystem not found | `kwindowsystem` | `kf6-kwindowsystem-devel` |
| KGlobalAccel | kglobalaccel not found | `kglobalaccel` | `kf6-kglobalaccel-devel` |
| KPipeWire | pipewire integration | `kpipewire` | `kf6-kpipewire-devel` |

#### Library Dependencies (pkg_check_modules)

| Library | Arch Package | Fedora Package |
|---|---|---|
| `libqalculate` | `libqalculate` | `libqalculate-devel` |
| `libpipewire-0.3` | `pipewire` | `pipewire-devel` |
| `aubio` | `aubio` | `aubio-devel` |
| `libcava` | `libcava` | `celestelove/libcava` (COPR) |
| `libpulse` | `libpulse` | `pulseaudio-libs-devel` |
| `libpam` | `pam` | `pam-devel` |
| `lm_sensors` (Fedora) | not needed | `lm_sensors-devel` |

**Fedora note:** The custom `cmake/sensorslib.cmake` module loads `lm_sensors`. If it's missing, the build may silently skip sensor support.

### 1.3 "Missing QML Module Metadata" After Build

```text
[ERR] Missing QML module metadata: $HOME/.local/lib/qt6/qml/Caelestia/Config/qmldir
```

This means the CMake install step didn't copy required `qmldir` or `.so` files properly.

**Causes & fixes:**
- **Install prefix mismatch:** The build uses `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local`. If Qt6 looks for QML modules elsewhere, the module won't load.
- **Stale build artifacts:** Run `rm -rf shell/build shell/plugin/build` before re-running
- **Partial installation:** If CMake install was interrupted, files may be missing. Re-run `08-build-shell.sh`

### 1.4 ccache Not Speeding Up Rebuilds

The project enables ccache in both `installer/CMakeLists.txt` and `shell/CMakeLists.txt`. If rebuilds are still slow:

- Check ccache stats: `ccache -s`
- The cache directory (`~/.cache/ccache`) may be too small — increase it: `ccache -M 5G`
- Debug builds (`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`) are much slower; the installer uses `Release`

---

## 2. Dependency & Package Issues

### 2.1 Arch Linux / yay Failures

| Issue | Cause |
|---|---|
| `yay` fails to install | Network issues, AUR down, or PKGBUILD changes. The script (`installDP.sh`) retries individually and falls back to `makepkg -si`. |
| `pacman` errors during install | The script uses `-Sy --noconfirm` (refresh DB) then `-S --needed --noconfirm`. If the system update step (`00a-system-update.sh`) was skipped, partial upgrades can cause conflicts. |

**AUR packages used by Caelestia:**

| AUR Package | Failure Symptoms |
|---|---|
| `quickshell-git` | Shell won't start; autostart fails with exit 127 |
| `caelestia-cli` | `caelestia` command not found; shell falls back to direct `quickshell` calls |
| `kde-material-you-colors` | Colors won't sync with wallpaper |
| `darkly` | KDE theme won't apply |

### 2.1a Void Linux / XBPS Notes

| Issue | Cause / Fix |
|---|---|
| `sudo xbps-install -y <pkg>` fails with "Unable to locate" | Package name doesn't exist in Void or the index is stale — run `sudo xbps-install -S` first. The installer retries every package individually and logs failures to `~/.cache/caelestia-kde/failed_packages.txt`. |
| `Failed to mount /` during `xbps-install` inside a container/chroot | Harmless procfs warning in containers; installs still succeed. |
| `quickshell` features missing at runtime | Void ships a stable (non-git) quickshell. If the shell reports missing QML features, build quickshell from source and ensure `~/.local/bin` precedes `/usr/bin` in `PATH`. |
| Source builds (`ydotool`, `libcava`, `darkly`) fail | Ensure `base-devel` is installed; Void needs no `makepkg`. Build errors are logged to stderr during `02-all-packages.sh`. |
| Fonts missing icons | The Nerd Fonts are downloaded directly to `~/.local/share/fonts` on Void (same as the Debian path); re-run `scripts/02-all-packages.sh` and check for download failures. |

### 2.2 Fedora / COPR Failures

| Package | COPR / Source | Known Issues |
|---|---|---|
| `quickshell-git` | `errornointernet/quickshell` | COPR may be out of date |
| `gpu-screen-recorder` | `brycensranch/gpu-screen-recorder-git` | May need `ffmpeg` from RPM Fusion |
| `app2unit` | `celestelove/app2unit` | Falls back to `make install` |
| `libcava` | `celestelove/libcava` | Falls back to manual build from GitHub |
| `starship` | `atim/starship` | Stable, rarely fails |
| `wl-clip-persist` | `leloubil/wl-clip-persist` | Needed for clipboard persistence |

**RPM Fusion requirement:** `ffmpeg` with H264 support requires RPM Fusion. The script auto-enables it, but this may fail behind a proxy or on air-gapped systems.

**kde-material-you-colors on Fedora:** Installed via `uv tool install`. Requires `dbus-devel`, `dbus-glib-devel`, and `python3-devel`.

### 2.3 CRLF / dos2unix Failure

If CRLF line endings are detected and `dos2unix` auto-install fails, the installer **aborts** with:

```text
[FATAL] Line ending normalization step failed. Aborting installer.
```

**Fix:** Install `dos2unix` manually, or answer `n` to the CRLF prompt to skip normalization.

### 2.4 Failed Packages Log

Failed packages are logged to:

```text
$XDG_CACHE_HOME/caelestia-kde/failed_packages.txt
```

The installer does **not** abort on package failure — it logs and continues. Check this file after installation if something doesn't work.

---

## 3. Runtime Issues — Shell

### 3.1 Shell Doesn't Start After Login

The shell autostarts via `~/.config/autostart/caelestiashell.desktop` which runs `~/.local/bin/caelestia-autostart.sh`.

| Symptom | Likely Cause |
|---|---|
| Blank screen at login | Shell binary launched but crashed immediately. Check `journalctl --user -xe`. |
| Plasma desktop visible, no shell | Autostart entry didn't execute. Verify the `.desktop` file exists. |
| Shell appears briefly then disappears | Quickshell crashed. Run manually from a terminal. |
| `quickshell: command not found` | Quickshell not in PATH at login. The autostart wrapper resolves the binary path. |

**Manual start for debugging:**
```bash
export QML2_IMPORT_PATH="$HOME/.local/lib/qt6/qml"
export CAELESTIA_LIB_DIR="$HOME/.local/lib/caelestia"
quickshell -d -n -p ~/.config/quickshell/caelestia/shell.qml
```

### 3.2 Environment Variables Not Set On Login

The build script appends to `~/.bashrc` and `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```bash
export QML2_IMPORT_PATH="$HOME/.local/lib/qt6/qml"
export CAELESTIA_LIB_DIR="$HOME/.local/lib/caelestia"
```

**Known issues:**
- **Zsh users:** Only `.bashrc` and `fish/config.fish` are updated — add the exports to `~/.zshrc` manually
- **Duplicate lines:** Running the installer multiple times adds duplicate exports
- **Fish users:** The grep check may miss existing entries if they're set via a different mechanism

### 3.3 Window Thumbnails / Screencast Not Working

KWin only grants `zkde_screencast_unstable_v1` to clients whose `.desktop` file lists the protocol.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify the desktop file exists
cat ~/.local/share/applications/quickshell.desktop
# Rebuild KService cache
kbuildsycoca6 --noincremental
# Reload KWin
qdbus6 org.kde.KWin /KWin reconfigure
```

If the desktop file is missing, re-run `scripts/10-autostart.sh`.

### 3.3.1 Screen Sharing / Camera Freezes Vesktop (or other apps)

Some NVIDIA + KWin setups cannot handle two separate clients using KWin's
privileged `zkde_screencast_unstable_v1` protocol at the same time. Caelestia
uses this protocol for live taskbar/overview/alt-tab window thumbnails, which
can conflict with another app's screencast (e.g. Vesktop screen share with
audio, or camera) using the same KWin subsystem via xdg-desktop-portal-kde,
causing that app to freeze or crash.

**Fix:** Disable live window previews:
- Nexus -> Taskbar -> "Live window previews" toggle, or
- Set `"bar": { "livePreviews": false }` in `shell.json` and reload

This falls back to static app icons for thumbnails instead of live video and
avoids Caelestia's use of the protocol entirely.

### 3.4 Material You Colors Not Working

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Colors not updating with wallpaper | systemd distros: `systemctl status --user kde-material-you-colors.service`. Void/runit: `pgrep -af kde-material-you-colors` |
| Service failed to start | On Fedora/Void, installed via `uv`. If `uv` isn't in PATH at login, the service fails. |
| Old schemes accumulating | The installer removes old `MaterialYou*.colors`, but multiple restarts can recreate them. |

**Manual restart (systemd distros):**
```bash
systemctl --user restart kde-material-you-colors.service
journalctl --user -u kde-material-you-colors.service -n 50
```

**On Void (runit):** `kde-material-you-colors` runs as an XDG autostart entry
(`~/.config/autostart/kde-material-you-colors.desktop`). Restart it by killing
the process and logging back in, or run it again manually in the background:
`kde-material-you-colors &`.

### 3.5 Screen Recording Issues

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| Recording appears stuck | `gpu-screen-recorder` not installed or not in PATH |
| Portal dialog doesn't appear | The `caelestia-record` wrapper restarts `plasma-xdg-desktop-portal-kde` and `xdg-desktop-portal` before launching `gpu-screen-recorder`. If the portal still doesn't appear, restart them manually: `systemctl --user restart plasma-xdg-desktop-portal-kde xdg-desktop-portal`. |
| Recording doesn't start | `caelestia-record` wraps `gpu-screen-recorder` directly with KDE-specific monitor detection (via `kscreen-doctor`) and portal management. No Python/OpenCV dependency. |

The recorder now verifies both `pidof gpu-screen-recorder` AND that `recording.mp4` exists, preventing false positives from stale PID matches.

### 3.6 Screenshot Issues

The screenshot tool uses `spectacle` (KDE's native screenshot utility) via the `caelestia-screenshot` wrapper.

- If `spectacle` isn't installed, screenshots silently fail
- Full-screen screenshots save to `~/Pictures/Screenshots/` by default

---

## 4. Runtime Issues — Lock Screen

### 4.1 Lock Screen Shows Default KDE Wallpaper

The lock screen runs inside `plasma-wallpaper-application` as a proxy workaround, because KWin blocks third-party Wayland lock screen clients.

**Diagnostic commands:**
```bash
# Verify plugin is installed
kpackagetool6 --list -t Plasma/Wallpaper
# Read the configured command
kreadconfig6 --file kscreenlockerrc --group Greeter --group Wallpaper --group net.dosowisko.PlasmaApplicationWallpaper --group General --key command
```

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| Default KDE wallpaper on lock | `plasma-wallpaper-application` plugin not installed. Install from `src/plasma-wallpaper-application/`: `kpackagetool6 -t Plasma/Wallpaper -i package` |
| Black screen on lock | Quickshell can't connect to the proxy socket. Check QML import paths in the plugin settings. |
| Lock screen ignores input | PAM configuration may be incorrect. Check `shell/assets/pam.d/`. |

### 4.2 High CPU Usage While Locked

The lock screen renders via a nested Wayland compositor using **software compositing** — every frame is rendered on the CPU.

**If CPU usage is >30% while locked:**

1. **Reduce FPS:** In KDE System Settings → Screen Locking → Wallpaper plugin settings, set FPS to `1`–`15`
2. **Remove animated widgets:** Animated lock screen widgets continuously generate frames
3. **Snap values, don't animate:** On timer-updated data (CPU, RAM), use instant value updates rather than `Behavior` animations

**Developer rules (from lock screen architecture):**
- No continuous animations (rotation, marquees, scrolling text)
- Synchronize polling intervals across widgets to batch frame damage
- Don't combine `Behavior` animations with 1-second timer updates
- Set `ShaderEffectSource.live = false` except during transitions

---

## 5. Configuration Issues

### 5.1 Darkly Theme Not Applied

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| Plasma style unchanged | `APPLY_DARKLY` was set to `false` in the configuration menu |
| Window decorations missing | The installer tries `org.kde.darkly` library, falls back silently to `org.kde.breeze` |
| `lookandfeeltool --apply "Darkly"` failed | The `darkly` package may not be installed (AUR/COPR only) |

**Manual apply:**
```bash
kwriteconfig6 --file kwinrc --group "org.kde.kdecoration2" --key "library" "org.kde.darkly"
kwriteconfig6 --file kwinrc --group "org.kde.kdecoration2" --key "theme" "@darkly"
qdbus6 org.kde.KWin /KWin reconfigure
```

### 5.2 KDE OSD Still Showing

The tweak script disables OSD in `plasmarc`, `kdeglobals`, `plasmanotifyrc`, `powerdevilrc`, and `kmixrc`. If OSD still appears:

```bash
systemctl --user restart plasma-plasmashell
```

Some KDE versions (6.1 vs 6.2) may use slightly different config keys.

### 5.3 Wrong Number of Virtual Desktops

The installer configures exactly **5 desktops**. If you had a different count before:
- Re-run `scripts/09-system-tweaks.sh` to re-apply
- The uninstaller resets desktop count to `1`

### 5.4 Keyboard Shortcut Conflicts

Caelestia's `GlobalShortcut` system uses `kglobalacceld`. When it registers a shortcut that conflicts with another app, it "steals" the binding and records it in:

```text
~/.config/caelestia/stolen-shortcuts.json
```

**If shortcuts are missing or wrong:**
```bash
rm -f ~/.config/caelestia/stolen-shortcuts.json
systemctl --user status plasma-kglobalaccel.service
```

If `keyd` is active and manages Meta+1..5, the tweak script skips KWin bindings for those combos to avoid conflicts.

### 5.5 Terminal Sequence Bleeding (Garbled Output)

If ANSI escape sequences leak from the `caelestia` CLI into your terminal:

```bash
cat $XDG_CACHE_HOME/caelestia-kde/failed_patches.txt
```

If `Caelestia CLI Theme Sequence Patch` appears in the failed list, re-run:
```bash
bash scripts/09-system-tweaks.sh
```

---

## 6. Network & Proxy Issues

### 6.1 Pacman Mirror Ranking Fails

On CachyOS, the installer uses the native `cachyos-rate-mirrors` command, which ranks both Arch and CachyOS repositories. Other Arch-based systems use `reflector` as a fallback. Fedora refreshes its configured DNF metadata and Debian-based systems refresh their configured APT indexes; neither needs mirror-list rewriting during installation. Failure modes:
- **Offline:** Mirror ranking fails and the existing mirror lists are kept
- **cachyos-rate-mirrors unavailable:** CachyOS mirror ranking is skipped and the existing mirror lists are kept
- **reflector not installed:** On non-Cachy Arch systems, it is auto-installed via `pacman -Sy reflector`; if that fails, ranking is skipped
- **DNF or APT refresh fails:** Fedora/Debian package installation continues and reports the package-manager error later if the configured sources remain unavailable

### 6.2 Git / Submodule Failures

The submodule `src/dots` is critical. If `git submodule update --init --recursive` fails:

```text
[ERR] Missing src/dots content. Run: git submodule update --init --recursive src/dots
```

This is a **hard failure** — the installer cannot proceed past config deployment.

**Behind a proxy?**
```bash
git config --global http.proxy http://proxy:port
git config --global https.proxy http://proxy:port
export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1
```

### 6.3 AUR Builds Fail Behind Proxy

`makepkg -si` downloads sources from various URLs. Set proxy environment variables before running `setup.sh`:
```bash
export http_proxy=http://proxy:port
export https_proxy=http://proxy:port
export ALL_PROXY=http://proxy:port
```

---

## 7. Tmux & Terminal Issues

### 7.1 Tmux Session Doesn't Start Properly

The installer re-execs itself inside a tmux session with split panes.

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Session appears then vanishes | Process exited immediately | The wrapper script (`/tmp/caelestia_tmux_wrapper.sh`) should prevent this. Check it exists. |
| `Another Caelestia setup is already running` | Stale lock file | `rm -f "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}/caelestia-setup.lock"` |
| `INSTALLER SESSION ENDED (exit code: 1)` with no log | Binary crashed before writing stderr, or `/tmp` was full | Check available disk space |

### 7.2 Worker Pane Communication Fails

The C++ installer communicates with the worker tmux pane via named pipes:
- `/tmp/caelestia_cmd` — command FIFO
- `/tmp/caelestia_status` — status FIFO

**Failure modes:**
- **FIFO deadlock:** If the worker pane's `while read` loop exits, the `O_WRONLY` open blocks. Handled via `O_NONBLOCK` fallback.
- **Safety timeout:** Steps that hang >30 minutes are treated as failed.
- **ENXIO:** If the FIFO reader disappears (pane crash), the step is failed immediately.

### 7.3 Terminal Rendering Problems

The TUI uses advanced terminal escape sequences:

| Feature | Sequence | Terminal Support |
|---|---|---|
| Sync mode (tear-free) | `\x1b[?2026h` / `\x1b[?2026l` | Not all terminals support this |
| Alt-screen buffer | `\x1b[?1049h` | Most terminals support this |
| SIGWINCH handling | Window resize signal | Some tmux configs don't forward SIGWINCH |

**Requirements:**
- 24-bit true color support
- Synchronized Updates (DEC private mode 2026)
- UTF-8 encoding for box-drawing characters

---

## 8. KDE & Plasma Specific Issues

### 8.0 Void Linux (runit) — service model differences

On Void there is no systemd. Everything this project would register as a
`systemd --user` unit is instead managed as an **XDG autostart entry**:

| Component | systemd (other distros) | Void (runit) |
|---|---|---|
| Clipboard history | `cliphist.service` | `~/.config/autostart/cliphist.desktop` |
| OSK key injection | `ydotoold.service` | `~/.config/autostart/ydotoold.desktop` |
| Material You colors | `kde-material-you-colors.service` | `~/.config/autostart/kde-material-you-colors.desktop` |
| Ollama (optional) | `ollama.service` (system) | runit service `/etc/sv/ollama` |

Notes:

- System services are managed with `sv`: `sudo sv status /var/service/NetworkManager`, etc.
- Session/power actions (suspend, poweroff) go through **elogind** over D-Bus,
  no systemd required.
- `uinput` is loaded at boot via `/etc/modules-load.d/uinput.conf` (Void reads
  this directory natively).
- Packages that don't exist in the Void repos (`ydotool`, `libcava`,
  `app2unit`, `darkly`, `caelestia-cli`) are built from source by
  `sdata/void-dist/installDP_void.sh`; check
  `~/.cache/caelestia-kde/failed_packages.txt` after install.

### 8.1 Legacy qs-kwin-bridge Service

The old `qs-kwin-bridge` Python daemon is now **disabled** in favor of native C++ plugins. If you see it running:
```bash
systemctl --user disable --now qs-kwin-bridge.service
```
(On Void there is no systemd unit; if a stale `qs-kwin-bridge` process exists, just `pkill -f qs-kwin-bridge`.)

### 8.2 xdg-desktop-portal-kde

The recording patch restarts `plasma-xdg-desktop-portal-kde` before each recording. This may fail if:
- The portal service is masked
- The user's systemd session is in a bad state

### 8.3 ydotoold (On-Screen Keyboard)

`ydotoold` needs access to `/dev/uinput`. The installer:
1. Creates `/etc/udev/rules.d/80-uinput.rules`
2. Adds user to `input` group
3. Creates sudoers NOPASSWD rule

**If ydotoold doesn't work:**
- Re-login (group changes take effect on next login)
- Verify: `groups $USER` should include `input`
- Verify: `ls -la /run/user/$(id -u)/.ydotool_socket`

### 8.4 Krohnkite Tiling Disabled on Uninstall

The uninstaller disables `krohnkiteEnabled` in `kwinrc`. If you don't have the Krohnkite KWin script installed, this setting is simply ignored.

### 8.5 KWin Script Injection Fails

The plugin injects a temporary KWin script for window tracking. If KWin scripting is disabled:
```bash
qdbus6 org.kde.KWin /Scripting org.kde.kwin.Scripting.loadScript
```

---

## 9. Post-Install Issues

### 9.1 Shell Not Visible After Install

The shell only runs at **next login**. After the summary screen, the installer asks: *"Would you like to log out now? (y/N)"*

If you chose not to log out:
1. Log out manually (`Super+Ctrl+Q` or KDE menu → Leave → Log Out)
2. Log back in
3. If the shell still doesn't appear, run: `caelestia shell -d`

### 9.2 Installer Exited Prematurely (Marker Check)

The outer `setup.sh` wrapper checks if `[installer] done (success)` appears in stderr:

| Condition | Warning |
|---|---|
| Exit 0 but elapsed < 3 seconds without marker | **"INSTALLER EXITED PREMATURELY"** |
| Exit 0 but elapsed > 3 seconds without marker | **"INSTALLER EXITED UNEXPECTEDLY"** |

### 9.3 CONFIRM_ARG Behavior

The configuration menu sets `CONFIRM_ARG` as `true`/`false`. The installer converts it per-script context:
- Some scripts use `-n "$CONFIRM_ARG"` (non-empty = auto-confirm)
- The C++ code has a known inconsistency — see `Runner.cpp` comments for details

### 9.4 Stale Lock Files

If the script is killed with **SIGKILL** (not SIGTERM), lock files may persist:

| Lock File | Script |
|---|---|
| `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}/caelestia-setup.lock` | `setup.sh` |
| `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}/caelestia-update.lock` | `update.sh` |

**Always use Ctrl+C (SIGINT)** which is handled gracefully. Remove stale locks:
```bash
rm -f "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}/caelestia-setup.lock"
rm -f "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/tmp}/caelestia-update.lock"
```

### 9.5 Update.sh Fails

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| `git pull` fails | Uncommitted changes exist. The updater auto-stashes, but conflicts may remain. |
| Submodule update fails | Network issue or GitHub down. Retry later. |
| CMake configure fails | New dependencies added since last install. Check error output. |

---

## 10. Uninstall Issues

### 10.1 No Backups Available

Backups are stored in `$BUNDLE_DIR/backups/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`. If you moved or deleted the repository, backups are gone.

### 10.2 konsave Restore Fails

If the `.knsv` archive is corrupted or konsave can't be installed:
- Falls back to manual restore of individual config files
- If `python3 -m venv` fails (missing `python3-venv`), theme data can't be restored

**Expected warning when restoring a Caelestia backup:**
> *"The selected backup contains Caelestia configurations. Restoring this backup will NOT revert to a clean KDE desktop!"*

### 10.3 Shell RC Files Not Cleaned

The uninstaller uses state files (`shellrc/bashrc.state`, etc.) to determine whether to restore or remove shell config files. If these are missing (older installer version), a fallback `sed` cleanup removes `QML2_IMPORT_PATH` and `CAELESTIA_LIB_DIR` lines.

### 10.4 Package Removal Leaves Dependencies

Package removal is optional. It uses `yay -Rns` / `dnf remove` which does NOT remove:
- Dependencies pulled in automatically (unless `-s` handles it)
- Packages installed outside the defined lists
- `base-devel` or build tools that existed before install

### 10.5 Input Group Membership Persists

The uninstaller runs `sudo gpasswd -d $USER input`. This only works if the user was added to the group during installation, and takes effect on next login.

### 10.6 Failed Patches Tracking

Failed patches are logged to:
```text
$XDG_CACHE_HOME/caelestia-kde/failed_patches.txt
```

Possible entries:
- `Caelestia CLI Hyprctl Mock Patch`
- `Caelestia CLI Record/Dolphin Patch`
- `Caelestia CLI Theme Sequence Patch`

These are **cosmetic** — the shell works without them, but certain features (screenshot, recording, terminal colors) may be degraded.
